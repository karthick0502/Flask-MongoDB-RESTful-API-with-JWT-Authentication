Hi,
I have gone through your mail and joining formalities of Spiceblue and I need discuss something with you
As you mentioned, I have below documents from my sideCopy of Address proof- Aadhar card, PAN Card, Passport
Copy of Education documents- Mark sheets of high school and collegeCopy of employment documents with all previous companies- Offer letter/ Letter of appointments, 6 months Payslips or bank statements.But the problem will be that I can't be sure whether I will be able to submit an experience certificate or not for My last recent company called 'MSC Technology'
Here, As per my current company terms and conditions, they will not provide a relieving letter If employee wants to be relieved from the company before 3 years. 
But I have Payslips, Hike letter and Offer Letter with me.
I have already discussed it with Shirthula through the phone. Now, I need confirmation from your side, whether you will be allowed to get work with you without submitting an experience letter or not?
Regards,karthick M
